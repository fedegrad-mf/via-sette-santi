# Saint Ruffino

Saint Ruffino is the patron saint who welcomes pilgrims at the beginning and end of their spiritual journey on the Via dei Sette Santi.

## History and Worship

The veneration of Saint Ruffino in this area dates back to the early centuries of Christianity. A martyr of the faith, his memory has been passed down from generation to generation by the mountain communities of the Sibillini.

The church dedicated to him represents not only a place of worship but also a geographical and spiritual reference point for the entire Tenna valley.

## The Church

The Romanesque building that houses the saint's remains is an architectural jewel. Its elevated position on a promontory allows visual dominance over the entire trail route, almost symbolizing the saint's protection over all pilgrims.

The interior, simple yet evocative, invites prayer and meditation. The thick walls and small windows create an atmosphere of recollection ideal for beginning or concluding the spiritual journey.
