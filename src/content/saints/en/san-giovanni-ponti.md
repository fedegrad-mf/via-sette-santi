description: Church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, located near ancient bridges over the Tenna river.
history: The Church of San Giovanni ai Ponti owes its name to its particular position near ancient bridges crossing the Tenna river. Saint John the Baptist, precursor of Christ and baptizer in the Jordan, is venerated here in symbolic relation to the river water. The church, of medieval origins, was a stopping point for travelers and pilgrims crossing the river along communication routes between the mountains and the coast. The structure has undergone numerous renovations over the centuries, particularly after various floods that tested its resistance. The building preserves an ancient baptismal font and frescoes depicting the baptism of Jesus.
