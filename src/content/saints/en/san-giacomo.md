history: Saint James the Greater, son of Zebedee and brother of John the Evangelist, was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus. His devotion spread throughout Europe through the famous Way of Santiago. In this Sibillini valley, a church dedicated to him testifies to the importance of pilgrimage routes even in more secluded areas. The church, of medieval origin, was probably erected by pilgrims traveling ancient communication routes between the Adriatic and Rome. Its essential architecture reflects the spirituality of Jacobean worship, centered on the journey as a metaphor for spiritual life.
