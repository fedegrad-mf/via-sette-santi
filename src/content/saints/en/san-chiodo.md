name: Holy Nail
church: Church of San Chiodo
location: Along the final route to San Ruffino
description: Church dedicated to the relic of the Holy Cross, symbolically represented by the nail of crucifixion.
history: The Church of San Chiodo has a particular denomination that does not refer to a saint in the proper sense, but to a relic of Christ's Passion: the nail of crucifixion. This type of dedication is rare but not unique in Italy, testifying to a particular devotion to the instruments of the Passion. The church, of medieval origin, probably preserves a relic or an image of the Holy Nail. The building, in its current structure, shows interventions from various periods but maintains the austere and penitential character appropriate to its dedication.
