name: Saint Mary of Mars
church: Church of Santa Maria di Marte
location: Amandola
description: Church dedicated to the Madonna, representing the Marian devotion deeply rooted in these lands.
history: The Church of Santa Maria di Marte in Amandola is one of the oldest religious buildings in the area. The particular name, "di Marte" (of Mars), could derive from a pre-existing ancient dedication later Christianized, a common phenomenon in the conversion of pagan worship sites. The current church features Romanesque and Gothic elements, testimony to various construction phases over the centuries. The building houses frescoes of considerable artistic value, some dating back to the 14th-15th centuries. The Madonna venerated here is considered the protector of Amandola and the entire valley, particularly invoked in times of difficulty such as earthquakes and epidemics.
