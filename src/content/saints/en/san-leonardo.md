name: Saint Leonard
church: Church of San Leonardo
location: In the woods, reachable from Rubbiano
description: Isolated church in the woods dedicated to Saint Leonard of Noblac, patron of prisoners and protector of forests.
history: The Church of San Leonardo stands in an isolated position in the heart of the forest, reachable only on foot from Rubbiano. Saint Leonard of Noblac was a 6th-century French hermit, disciple of Saint Remigius, who retired to the woods dedicating himself to prayer and assisting prisoners. His veneration spread throughout Europe, particularly in connection with forests and isolated places. The church in the Sibillini, probably founded by medieval hermits, maintains the character of a secluded and contemplative place. The structure, very simple, is built of local stone and integrates perfectly with the surrounding woodland environment.
