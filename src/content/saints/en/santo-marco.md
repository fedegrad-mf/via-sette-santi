location: Along the route between Amandola and San Ruffino
description: Rural church dedicated to Saint Mark the Evangelist, author of the second Gospel.
history: The Church of Santo Marco is a small rural church that stands in an isolated position along the trail route. Saint Mark the Evangelist, author of the second Gospel and traditionally identified with the young man who followed Jesus in the Garden of Olives, is the patron of Venice but is venerated in many Italian locations. The church, of modest size, presents architectural characteristics typical of rural chapels in the Sibillini: local stone masonry, gabled roof, bell gable. The interior, very simple, preserves a stone altar and an image of the saint with the lion, his traditional iconographic symbol.
