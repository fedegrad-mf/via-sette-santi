# From Rubbiano to San Leonardo (round trip)

The second stage is a loop hike that starts and returns to Rubbiano, leading to the evocative Church of San Leonardo, hidden in the heart of the forest.

## Route Description

This circular route offers a unique contemplative experience. The path winds through dense beech and maple forests, where silence is broken only by birdsong and the rustling of leaves.

The Church of San Leonardo suddenly emerges from the vegetation, a small architectural jewel that invites meditation and prayer.
