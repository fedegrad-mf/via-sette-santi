# From Amandola to San Ruffino

The final stage closes the loop of the spiritual journey, bringing pilgrims back to the Church of San Ruffino where it all began.

## Route Description

This concluding stage invites reflection on the journey traveled. The path gradually climbs towards the hills, crossing landscapes now familiar but still capable of amazement.

Along the route, you encounter the last two churches of the trail: Santo Marco and San Chiodo, thus completing the visit to all seven saints that give this pilgrimage route its name.

The return to San Ruffino has a special flavor: it's the completion of a circle, both geographical and spiritual.
