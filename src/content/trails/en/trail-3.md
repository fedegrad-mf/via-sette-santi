# From Rubbiano to Madonna dell'Ambro Sanctuary

The third stage represents the spiritual heart of the trail, leading to the famous Madonna dell'Ambro Sanctuary, one of the most important Marian worship sites in the Marche region.

## Route Description

The path develops with a series of ups and downs crossing varied landscapes: meadows, woods, and rocky outcrops. As you approach the sanctuary, the landscape becomes increasingly spectacular.
